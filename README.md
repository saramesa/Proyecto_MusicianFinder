# Proyecto_MusicianFinder

This proyect is what I developed as final work in 10 days at the ironhack front-end development course. I saved all my data in local storage so if you would like to see this musician finder working you should copy the database in your own local storage and initialize it with node.

What I intented to do is to create a platform for bars and local artist so they can find each other and make a contract.

Hope you like it!
